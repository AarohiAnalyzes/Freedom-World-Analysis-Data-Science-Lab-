# Freedom in the World  
## An Empirical Data Science Study on Digital Access, Gender Inclusion & Academic Freedom

---

## Project Overview

This project investigates how socio-economic factors influence democratic freedoms across countries using panel data from **2013–2023**.

By integrating governance indicators with development metrics, the study explores how **digital access, gender participation, and higher education** relate to civil liberties and institutional freedom.

The objective is to combine statistical modeling and machine learning techniques to uncover measurable global patterns behind democratic outcomes.

## Research Questions

1. Does Internet penetration improve Freedom of Expression?
2. Is Female Labor Force Participation associated with stronger Women’s Rights?
3. Do higher Tertiary Education levels predict Academic Freedom?

## Dataset

- Panel dataset covering 196+ countries  
- Time range: 2013–2023  
- Core freedom indicators:
  - Political Rights (PR)
  - Civil Liberties (CL)
  - Category Scores (A–G)
- Enriched with external socio-economic indicators:
  - Internet Penetration Rate
  - Female Labor Force Participation Rate
  - Tertiary Education Enrollment Rate

## Methodology

### Statistical Analysis
- Descriptive Statistics  
- Pearson & Partial Correlation  
- OLS Regression (Robust Standard Errors)  
- Bootstrapped Confidence Intervals  
- Mixed-Effects (Multilevel) Modeling  
- Model Diagnostics (RMSE, MAE, VIF, Residual Analysis)

### Machine Learning

## Key Insights

- Higher Internet penetration shows a statistically significant association with improved civil liberties.
- Female labor force participation correlates with stronger women’s rights protections, especially in politically freer systems.
- Tertiary education levels are positively associated with academic freedom, though effects vary across political statuses.
